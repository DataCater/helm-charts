Get the application URL by running these commands:

GCP will create a mangedcertificate for the DNS you provided:

    datacater.publicDomainName: {{ .Values.datacater.publicDomainName }}

Check the status of your managedcertification before going to above domain
with following command:

    kubectl describe managedcertificate platform-cert -n datacater

This might take ~60 min until the certificate is available.
See point 9 under https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/managed-certs#setting_up_a_google-managed_certificate
Happy Data Pipelines development on DataCater!
